# Block Banner Plugin

Experimental plugin for WordPress block themes to add global banner elements to the site. The banners are built as a CPT in the block editor and can be added ~~to any page or post~~ (coming soon) or globally to the site.

There's an option for setting the cookie exiration time for the banner, so it won't show up again for the user after they've closed it.

## Setup

Open the Site Editor and add the 'Banner Placeholder' block to your header template. This will be replaced with the banner content when a banner is active.
